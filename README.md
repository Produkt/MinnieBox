# MinnieBox
**MinnieBox** is an iPhone app developed during the Dropbox London Hackathon by [@fillito](http://twitter.com/fillito) and [@victorbaro](http://twitter.com/victorbaro), and designed by [@hugocornejo](http://twitter.com/hugocornejo).

**MinnieBox** scans all your dropbox files and presents them to you in a visual way, so you can easily free up some Dropbox space.

You can visit [this post](http://medium.com) to know a bit more about the project.

Finally, visit [this dribbble site](http://dribbble.com) to grab the designs for free.

## Still To do
- Sign out (allow user to sign out and sign in again with a different dropbox account)
- Handle shared content scenarios (if you remove something shared, it should be stop sharing it instead of deleting)
- Allow multiple selection in MinnieBox View Controller (as shown in design files)
- Change to red color on multiple selection Dropbox View Controller
- Add subtitle to Dropbbox View Controller showing % used (as shown in design files)
- Dropbox VC should have a tableview manager and toolbar manager objects
