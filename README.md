# MinnieBox
**MinnieBox** is an iPhone app developed during the Dropbox London Hackathon by [@fillito](http://twitter.com/fillito) and [@victorbaro](http://twitter.com/victorbaro), and designed by [@hugocornejo](http://twitter.com/hugocornejo).

**MinnieBox** scans all your dropbox files and presents them to you in a visual way, so you can easily free up some Dropbox space.

You can visit [this post](https://medium.com/produkt-blog/dropbox-hackathon-ceae4fc5d1db) to know a bit more about the project.
